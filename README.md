# Client-Server Socket program
A program which creates a socket between a client & server, where the server echoes whatever it receives back to the client.
<br> <br>
I made this to demonstrate how a client & server communicate using Python's Socket API.

**NOTE:** This program was written months ago & I only just uploaded the program onto GitHub, which is why all code was committed & pushed once.

# To run program
- Open a terminal or command prompt instance with administrative permissions
- Navigate to the directory with this program & and run `python echo-server.py`.
- Open another terminal or command prompt instance
- Navigate again and run `python echo-client.py`
